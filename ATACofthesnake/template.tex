\begin{abstract}
ATACofthesnake wraps together downstream analysis for ATAC data, starting from BAM files. 
Main objective is differential accessibility calling using DESeq2.
To achieve this goal, merged BAM files are created across comparisons. Subsequently peaks are called with MACS2 on the merged BAM file(s).
A couple of QC plots are created (PCA and correlation heatmaps), and bigwigs for visual inspection (bigwigs are normalized using TMM normalized scale factors calculated by edgeR).
This PDF file combines the output, and is aimed to provide initial inspection.
